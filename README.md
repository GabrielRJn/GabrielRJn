Close to graduation now, so I've decided to spend more than 30 seconds to write my GitHub README haha.

### My name is Gabriel, I'm a student that dropped out of Biomedical Sciences to pursue Computer Science with no knowledge other than how to make a C++ snake game from YouTube.  It was the best decision I've ever made.

### I've always wanted to learn about computers, I'm still learning now, and I love to learn about them! I am using university to start my journey of becoming more technically literate and grow my capabilities. I am looking for the next place I will be able to challenge myself.

Hi my name is Gabriel, I'm a Junior C# Developer that transitioned from Biomedical Science to Computer Science with no knowledge. It was the best decision I've ever made. 

I've always wanted to learn about computers, I'm still learning now, and I love to learn about them from other people. I've used university to start my journey of becoming more technically literate, and I hope to grow my capabilities.

### Currently learning ðŸŒ±
-Greenfield event driven ASP.NET projects (C#, React, SignalR, MobX)

### Other 
Interests: cloud, games, ai, art, netflix, music, journalling

### Note
Currently using Azure devops much more than Github

 **Take care ðŸ‘‹**

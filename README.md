Close to graduation now, so I've decided to spend more than 30 seconds to write my GitHub README haha.

**My name is Gabriel, I'm a student that transitioned from Biomedical Science to Computer Science with no knowledge. It was the best decision I've ever made. I've always wanted to learn about computers, I'm still learning now, and I love to learn about them from other people.**

**I am using university to start my journey of becoming more technically literate, and I hope to grow my capabilities.**
